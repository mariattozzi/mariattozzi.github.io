      After graduating from Northeastern University with a B.S. in Psychology,
      I’ll be volunteering as a lay missionary with the Servidoras, religious
      sisters of an institute called
      <a href="https://ssvmusa.org/" target="_blank"
        >Servants of the Lord and the Virgin of Matará</a
      >. I met these sisters in the summer of 2022 after mass in Chungli, Taiwan
      on a trip visiting my family. As I considered my next steps after
      graduation, I felt a strong calling to support women in building their
      self-esteem, along with a deep desire for adventure abroad. I remembered
      the nuns I met in Taiwan and reached out.

          The apostolate of the sisters in Taiwan involves enhancement programs
          at the church. During the summer they lead a summer camp for the
          children and language classes for all ages. For the month of July 2025
          I’ll be in Taiwan teaching English at Sacred Heart of Jesus parish.
          The program provides free English and Spanish classes for people of
          varying ages and skill levels. This month will be a useful time of
          adjustment into living in community life with the sisters in
          preparation for the next trip to Guyana.

          When I interviewed with the religious Mother she said that the sisters
          in Guyana had reached out a day prior if anyone with a Psychology
          background had applied to volunteer. The Mother there is a nurse, but
          she is seeking someone with a background in mental health, as family
          brokenness has contributed to mental health challenges, and high rates
          of abuse, suicidality, and hopelessness. I felt that God’s plan
          aligned for me at that moment as my education, purpose, and gifts
          could be used to serve and support women. For September through
          November 2025, I will be providing mental health support and
          empowering Guyana’s young women.
